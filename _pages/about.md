Hi, I am Jennifer Ahiable, a Ph.D. student at [Grup d’Informació i Fenòmens Quàntics](https://webs.uab.cat/giq/) of (Universitat Autonònoma de Barcelona) under the supervision of [Prof. Andreas Winter](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/andreas-winter-556) and [Prof. Anna Trigueros Sanpera](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/anna-sanpera--trigueros-318). Previously I completed a double major in mathematics and economics at the University of Ghana (BSc), a master in mathematical sciences from the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Rwanda under the supervison of [Prof. Rupert Levene](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b6Yt-DsAAAAJ&hl=en) and another master in mathematics from the University of Guelph in Canada under the supervison of [Prof. David Kribs](https://dkribs.uoguelph.ca/) and [Prof. Rajesh Pereira](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajesh-Pereira).




Research Interests
======
My main line of research lies in investigating rigorous theoretical ideas in entanglement theory. Specifically I am interested in the characterization of symmetric quantum states, absolutely separable states, and positive maps, as well as contributions to the certification of entangled states.
