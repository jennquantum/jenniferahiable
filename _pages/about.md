Hi, I am Jennifer Ahiable, a Ph.D. student at the [Grup d’Informació i Fenòmens Quàntics](https://webs.uab.cat/giq/) at Universitat Autonònoma de Barcelona, under the guidance of [Prof. Andreas Winter](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/andreas-winter-556) and [Prof. Anna Trigueros Sanpera](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/anna-sanpera--trigueros-318). My academic journey began with a double major in Mathematics and Economics from the University of Ghana (BSc), followed by a Master’s in Mathematical Sciences from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (Rwanda), supervised by [Prof. Rupert Levene](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b6Yt-DsAAAAJ&hl=en). I also hold a second Master’s in Mathematics from the University of Guelph (Canada), where I worked with [Prof. David Kribs](https://dkribs.uoguelph.ca/) and [Prof. Rajesh Pereira](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajesh-Pereira).




Research Interests
======
My research focuses on developing rigorous theoretical frameworks within entanglement theory. I am particularly interested in the characterization of symmetric quantum states, absolutely separable states, and the role of positive maps in quantum information. Additionally, I contribute to advancing methods for certifying entangled states, aiming to deepen our understanding of quantum systems and their applications.
